At first the difference in time difference between insert and append is tiny, but as each level of the array increases, the difference becomes much more drastic. When using the push function, all that the function has to do is add an element to the end of the array. But with unshift, it has to add an element and then shift all the other elements in the array one space down. Because there is that second action the function has to take, it creates a massive time difference between the functions over time. An exponential time difference to be exact.
